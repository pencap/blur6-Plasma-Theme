blur6 Plasma Theme
=================

### what is blur6?
* *blur6 is a desktop theme with transparency and blur for the KDE Plasma Desktop. The goal is to create a  consistent theme for the kde plasma user experience starting from the login screen till the shutdown dialog.*

* *blur6 is heavily inspired and build arround [Helium Plasma Theme](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/998869/) by mcder and [Helium_Wallpaper (4K) ](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1225178/) by Gfxcoorpinc .* 

* *blur6 includes a matching window theme for the kvantum engine based on the colors used by Helium.*

* *blur6 comes with a fitting aurorae window decoration theme to match the kvantum theme.* 

* *blur6 includes a konsole theme based on the Helium colors which I use for the terminal panel in Dolphin file manager and a seperate color scheme for the regular konsole window based on the colors of the wallpaper I use.*

* *blur6 offers a Splash Screen matching the wallpaper*
